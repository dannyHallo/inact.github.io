            The predecessor of steam pot is pottery hot pot. The predecessor of Steam Pot Chicken is Yanglin Chicken. In
            the early years, Yunnan poplar forest. In Jianshui and other places, the precious medicinal material
            Cordyceps sinensis is used to nestle chickens, which is called "Yanglin chicken", and the pottery hot pot
            for stewing chicken is called "Yanglin pot". Yanglin pot is produced in Jianshui, and Jianshui pottery has a
            history of more than one thousand years. <br />In the Qing Dynasty, Pan Jinhuai, a master potter, sintered
            red,
            yellow, purple, blue and white clay into colored pottery. In 1921, a potter named Xiang Fengchun inherited
            his ancestral craftsmanship and created a steam pot for cooking. <br />In this way, "Steam Pot Chicken"
            replaced
            "Yanglin Chicken". Steam boilers are now mass-produced by Jianshui Arts and Crafts Pottery Factory in Yunnan
            Province. People describe Jianshui pottery as "bright as water, bright as a mirror", "body like iron stone,
            and sound like a chime".<br /> In the 1960s, when Premier Zhou visited abroad, he brought Jianshui purple
            pottery
            boilers and vases as gifts to foreign friends.The predecessor of steam pot is pottery hot pot. The
            predecessor of Steam Pot Chicken is Yanglin Chicken.

                     The tableware for steam pot chicken must be tasted in Jianshui earthenware steam pot. Jianshui
                     steam pot has a simple shape and unique structure. It has an oblate belly and a hollow tube in the
                     center. The steam enters the pot along this tube, and after being cooled by the steam pot cover, it
                     turns into water and drips into the pot to become chicken soup. After two or three hours, the meat
                     cake is ready to eat.
