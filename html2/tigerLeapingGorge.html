              Shanghutiao is the narrowest section in the whole canyon, the river is only more than 20 meters wide. In
              the center of the river sits a boulder, about 13 meters high. Legend has it that a tiger once jumped to
              the opposite bank with this boulder. Because of the name "Tiger Leaping Rock", Tiger Leaping Gorge was
              named after this. The boulder splits the torrent in two.

              The Jinsha River becomes much gentler in the lower section of the Tiger Leaping Section, and the thrill of
              the canyon gradually disappears. The field of vision here is wide, and what you can see is fertile fields.
              You can not only appreciate the scenes of the Jinsha River singing and dancing, three times and nine
              turns, but also overlook the grace of the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain.
