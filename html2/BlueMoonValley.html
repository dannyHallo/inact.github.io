            Blue Moon Valley is located at the eastern foot of Yulong Snow Mountain in Yulong Naxi Autonomous County,
            Lijiang City, Yunnan Province, commonly known as "White Water River". Named for its crescent shape.
            Blue Moon Valley is located in the valley north of Ganhaizi at the eastern foot of Yulong Snow Mountain and
            south of Yunshanping. Its predecessor was the "Baishui River" known to people earlier.<br />
            On sunny days, the color of the water is blue, and the valley is crescent-shaped. From a distance, it looks
            like a blue moon inlaid at the foot of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, so it is called Blue Moon Valley.
            The name Baishui River is because the mud at the bottom of the lake is white, and the water will turn white
            when it rains, so it is also called Baishui River.<br />
            The river in the Blue Moon Valley was blocked by mountains during its flow, forming four large water
            surfaces, known as Yuye Lake, Jingtan Lake, Blue Moon Lake and Tingtao Lake.

                     The water quality of Yuye Lake is very clear. You can see the pure white bottom at a glance. The
                     blue lake water reflects the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain not far away. The annual average temperature
                     in the lake area is -4.0~-2.0â„ƒ, and the annual precipitation is about 100mm. The water of the lake
                     is mainly supplied by a
                     number of seasonal rivers formed by the melting water of Nari Snow Mountain.

                     Lanyue Lake is surrounded by green mountains and green trees. Under the bright sunshine, the
                     jasper-like lake surface is shining like sapphires, giving people a feeling of immortality and
                     fantasy. The poet wrote that "at sunrise, the river flowers are more red than fire, and in spring,
                     the river water is as green as blue".
