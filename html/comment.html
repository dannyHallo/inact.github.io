            Became a "Tibetan girl" in Lijiang！Wearing Tibetan clothes, I feel a kind of primitive
            and tenacious "vitality". I always have a Tibetan dream in my heart, but I don't have
            the time and energy to go to such a high altitude place. I feel the magical experience
            brought by nature in Lijiang.

            Recently, my work condition is not so good. I came to the Blue Moon Valley in Lijiang,
            which made me forget all my troubles. Beauty is like painting! It is recommended that
            you visit when the weather is fine. Around 4 PM, the light in Blue Moon Valley is the
            best time to take photos!

            I have long heard that Lijiang Snow Mountain Art Town is very busy on every six days of
            the week. This weekend, there is a band performing there, there are young people
            walking, middle-aged people walking dogs, and children playing. The market sells
            handicrafts and desserts and drinks. The town market is artistic, chatting around the
            campfire, indescribably happy!

            Today, we went to 7 sea bar, the most valuable coffee shop in Lijiang, whose balcony on
            the second floor has a good view of the snow mountains. The waiter was super nice and
            offered to help us. We had tiramisu and waffles and they were delicious, they were
            delicious.

            Sakura Restaurant is a great place to take photos. My friends and I dressed in Tibetan
            clothes to take photos here. Their taste is spicy, indoor there are a lot of flowers,
            let us in the sea of flowers.

            7 sea bar is really crowded, but it's really worth a visit. Now and then the boss will
            play a guitar solo. It's so cozy.

            As the most famous market in Lijiang, Xueshan Art Town has lots of lounge chairs and
            tables for us to rest on, as well as fairytale houses that are perfect for photos. In
            the evening, there will be a bonfire party. lisa and I will dance around the bonfire
            together.

            The water in Blue Moon Valley is so beautiful, it does not need any filter, like jelly.
            Originally, I thought the scenery would not be as good as before in the off-season. Only
            when I arrived here did I see Blue Moon Valley is beautiful beyond my imagination.
